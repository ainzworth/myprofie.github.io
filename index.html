            <p><b>What is your interests in IT? when did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience.</b></p>
            <p>To me, I think of learning IT as a bridge to accomplish an achievement of mine, which is to develop a game that everyone loves to play. </p>
            <p>At the beginning, I think that IT is all about coding and stuffs that will help me to create a game and as simply as that I decided to take up the IT course. Only when after I have joined the IT course did I realized how cruel the reality is and IT is so much more than just some codes. But the glowing hope of creating a game product that everyone love is still there inside me, it takes place as a great motivation for me to continue this path. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-4 order-3 order-lg-3">
            <p>Again, coding is such a new and strange field that I have just discovered recently and therefore I have no experience in this field so I decided to chosen the most reliable environment which is the RMIT university. When it come to the RMIT environment, I am looking forward to not only just to learn about major but also about the soft-skills that a 21 citizens are required to have such as problem solving, collaboration, and so much more.</p>

People with this personality type are natural Makers, moving from project to project, building the useful and the superfluous for the fun of it, and learning from their environment as they go. Often mechanics and engineers, Virtuosos find no greater joy than in getting their hands dirty pulling things apart and putting them back together, just a little bit better than they were before.</p>

            My Project
          </font>
        </h7>
        <p><b>Overview</b></p>
        <p>A random name generator for games products that creates exotic and unique names based on algorithms. Applying self-learning machine techniques or create a lexical rule for how names are generated</p>
        <p><b>Motivation</b></p>
        <p>More than 1000 games each year and thousands more of start-up companies is created are created. According to statistics, this percentage has received a rising in popularity in recent years. And many of these company need to have a name for their new branches which is catchy, short and fit well for their company’s purposes. Regarding the game products, this program can be used as a random name generator as well as a way to collect information from players so that the developers can understand more about their players in order to be adaptive and improve their game. Therefore, this project was born in order to alleviate the needs of society for a multi-purpose application.</p>
        <p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>This application exists as a software that have to be paid in order to use</p>
          <p>The user enters a name or a keyword that they want their name to be based on or relevant to it. The purpose is to get the name ideas so that the generator can create short, catchy names, the clearer the keywords, the better the results. There is also a filter system in order to make the name more suitable by categorizing it into many categories such as your favorite characters, film, etc. In order to understand the user need, this application also consists of a self-learning machine so the more data that it collects from the user, the better the results are.</p>
          <p>This application can be used in a variety of way. It can exist in a form of a website to generate random name for free in order to popularize this application. Or it can be sold for companies that need this program for their own purposes.The application can also work as a system that collects data and information from users, store it and send it to the developers. This allow the creators to understand about their customers or game developers to know more about the players need and what changes should be made base on the data the system gathered.</p>
        <p><b>Skills Required </b></p>
        <p>Advance coding skills, require years of experience in coding. Knowing as many coding languages as possible such as python, C++,…</p>
        <p>To create a self-learning machine you need to have: Knowledge about matrix, vector, statistics and calculus</p>
          <p>Understand about basics concept of ML such as Linear algebra, probability theory, calculus, optimization theory, programming</p>
          <p><b>Tools and Technologies </b></p>
        <p>a mac or any kinds of computers which is capable of programming</p>
        <p>A advance programing platform such as pycharm,etc</p>
